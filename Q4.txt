Q4.B
I actually created several iterations of addWord that didn't
successfully add the word in the correct spot, but had the
other areas done correctly, but was having trouble narrowing 
down the problem, and as a result it took me ~6.5 hours to get
a working version. I was having trouble focusing and all the
ifs and loops probably didn't help, plus N-ary trees are 
probably the data structure I'm least familiar with. I
don't think the time I spent on the assignment is an 
accurate reflection of the difficulty level.
